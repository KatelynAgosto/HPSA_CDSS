                        They inhibit COX enzymes to reduce inflammation and pain; however, they carry risks like gastrointestinal bleeding and renal issues.
                        Prophylactic gastric protection (e.g., proton pump inhibitors) is recommended if used long-term.<br>
                        <strong>Acetaminophen</strong>: Commonly used at a maximum dose of 4000 mg per 24 hours; risks include hepatotoxicity, especially in patients with liver disease. 
                        Additionally, consider acetaminophen as the preferred nonopioid for mild to moderate pain in older adults. 
                        It is often used for postoperative pain management because it has no effect on platelets and fewer adverse effects than NSAIDs.

                    Dosages should be tailored individually, and short-acting opioids can be converted to long-acting options as needed.<br>
                    Additionally, initiate opioid therapy with a 25% to 50% dose reduction and slowly titrate dosage by 25% of that initial dose until there is either a 50% reduction in the patient's pain rating or the patient reports satisfactory pain relief. 
                    Older adults generally receive greater peak and longer duration of action from opioids than younger individuals.

                   Using acetaminophen with tramadol may provide additional analgesic relief. Tramadol is commercially available in combination with acetaminophen for short-term moderate pain. 
                   However, this formulation is not appropriate for more severe pain because the recommended maximum daily dose of both acetaminophen and tramadol can be easily exceeded.<br>

                      Corticosteroids are also used to improve appetite and mood.

                         Plan timing and depth of education based on the older adultâ€™s current pain state. Teach when pain is relatively well-controlled with analgesics. 
                         Pain relief must be a priority. Provide ongoing explanations of procedures or treatments as knowing what to expect can allay fear and anxiety and help to decrease pain.
