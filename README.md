The Hospice Pain Screening and Assessment (HPSA) Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) is designed to enhance pain screening and assessment workflows for hospice patients, focusing on improving care quality for older adults experiencing acute physical pain. This system utilizes evidence-based guidelines, including the Acute Pain Management in Older Adults and the WHO three-step ladder for pain management. HPSA CDSS incorporates the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) for verbal patients and the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia (PAINAD) scale for non-verbal patients, the HPSA CDSS provides structured workflows and treatment recommendations based on pain severity. Built-in R using Shiny, the HPSA CDSS is an interactive web-based application for hospital staff such as nurses and physicians. The forms are separated to allow flexibility for different users, The PAINAD assessment is noted as must be completed by a physician or nurse. The BPI assessment can be completed by or in collaboration with the physician, nurse, caregiver, or patient. 

The HPSA CDSS source code is available in two files: HPSA_CDSS Forms Prototype Final.R and HPSA_CDSS Prototype 10 - Final.R. The HPSA_CDSS Forms Prototype Final.R file defines the assessment format, enabling users to input and structure data based on standardized tools like the BPI and PAINAD. Meanwhile, the HPSA_CDSS Prototype 10 - Final.R file contains the actual workflow for the CDSS, integrating decision tables and trees to deliver clinical recommendations and follow-up reminders. These files allow users to explore and customize both the assessment forms and the decision-support workflows. By focusing on acute pain management in hospice patients, the HPSA CDSS promotes timely and effective interventions, reducing barriers to pain relief during end-of-life care.
